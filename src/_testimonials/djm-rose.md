CKD is about more than just attack and defence. The lessons learnt including the mind set that is developed can be applied to help you in many other aspects unrelated to martial arts, whether they are physical or mental. CKD is a system that is tailored to what works for you, you learn it all stand up and groundwork, but can focus on the techniques that fit your physique and attitude. Its fun, it's practical and it's rewarding.
