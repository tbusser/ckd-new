Clifford's classes are professional friendly and simply great!!! Whether your looking to get fit (boxercise) or be more technical (Chum Kun Do) these classes are for you. I have trained with Clifford for a while now and my family now enjoy the security of what he teaches. My wife and 2 children (11) and 5 year old and I simply love the workout. I can totally recommend his services and technique's watch how you or your children will grow confidents perfect for today's society.
