Its been a while since ive spoken to you but wanted to let you know that your classes really helped me. A few weeks ago I was talking to a group of YPs at work having just finsihed taking the lesson when a YP decided for what ever reason I do not know but he put me in a choker hold, not as tight as last time but enough. I really couldn't tell you how or what I did but the next thing he and I knew was that his arm was up his back and his hand touching his shoulder, this boy is about 6-1, he proceeded to bend himself onto a table to stop me from breaking his arm which I have to say I really did want to do but didnt and all with just my left hand. I proceeded to tell him never to touch me again in a very controlled manner and then released him. He said sorry about 20 mins later. I said you were really lucky as I wanted to break your arm and he said I know. So after a few wobblerly days I went back on the landings again. Confidence restored to almost my former glory. Thank you as I feel sure that it was your classes helped me to achieve this.
