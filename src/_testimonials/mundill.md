I cannot express enough gratitude and respect for your teaching of discipline and perseverance. Till this day The Tenants of "Courtesy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self Control and Indomitable spirit" runs through my mind and action. I still practice Katas which helps my mind and body to remain focused. I have a lot of respect for you.
